**What is Uber?**
Uber is a mobility service provider, allowing users to book rides and a driver to transport them in a way similar to a taxi. It is available on the web and mobile platforms such as Android and iOS.

To study any case study, we follow these 4 steps:
  1. Minimum Viable Product(MVP)
  2. Estimation Of Scale
  3. Design
  4. Design Deep Dive

1. **Minimum Viable Product(MVP):**
   **Customers:**
     a. Customers should be able to see cabs in the vicinity with an ETA and Pricing Information.
     b. Customer should be able to book a cab to a destination.
     c. Customer should be able to see the location of the driver.

   **Drivers:**
     a. Drivers should be able to accept/deny customer's requested ride.
     b. Once the driver accepts the ride, they should see the pickup location of the customer.
     c. Driver should be able to mark the trip as complete, on reaching the destination.

   **Non-Functional Requirements:**

     a. High reliability
     b. High availability with minimal latency
     c. System should be scalable and efficient.

   **Extended Requirements:**

   a. Customers can rate the trip after it’s completed.
   b. Payment processing.
   c. Metrics and analytics.

**2. Estimation Of Scale**
